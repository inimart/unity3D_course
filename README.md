# Unity3D Course Materials

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Unity3D course repository. This is where I've stashed some of the materials I use in my Unity3D lectures.

## What's this all about?

This repo isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide to everything Unity3D (that'd be a *lot* of stuff!).
Instead, it's more of a highlight reel of my teaching work over the past few years. Think of it as a sneak peek into my classroom!
If you want to dive deeper into any of the topics I cover here, or you are interested in a Unity3D collaboration for teaching/consulting, feel free to reach out. 

## What's inside?

The slides here are from my 2021 course. They're the result of countless hours of research and hard work.
While they're free to use, I'd really appreciate a shout-out in your credits if you use them directly or draw inspiration from them.
It's always nice to get a little recognition, right? ðŸ˜‰

## A quick note on images

Most of the slides contain images that I've either:
- Created by myself
- Grabbed as screenshots from the Unity editor
- Borrowed from the official Unity guide
- Sourced from Wikipedia or other open-source places

If you spot any images that you think might be from your site or book and I haven't given proper credit, please let me know. I'll fix it up right away!

## What topics are covered?

Here's a taste of what you'll find in these slides (but there's plenty more!):
Feel free to dive in and explore. If you have any questions or spot anything that needs fixing, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy learning! ðŸš€
